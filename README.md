# Smart Weather Classifier

In this project an Arduino based weather classifier has been made where in temperature is classified as hot, warm and cold, and humidity is classified as humid, sub-humid and dry. The temperature and humidity are sensed using DHT11- Temperature and Humidity sensor, which is shown on LCD display.

# Hardware Components
1) Arduino Uno
2) Atmega32
3) DHT11 sensor
4) LCD 16x2 display
